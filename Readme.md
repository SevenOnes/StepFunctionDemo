Welcome to Step Functions Demo

You can deploy lambdas with serverless:

```
sls deploy
```
Then go to your AWS Step Function console and copy/paste the machine definition in `machine.json`.

Before running this state machine in your AWS account please make sure you replace Lambda ARNs for your function with your your ARN.
